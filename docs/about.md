# About the Linear Algebra Book

In January of 2025 I was invited to lead a group of four students in a senior design project.  These were all student in their senior year at the University of Minnesota Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Design.  My team all were assigned to create an intelligent textbook for either a class they took or a subject they were interested in.  One of these students selected Linear Algebra.  This course is a fork of that textbook, but it has been redesigned significantly to focus on the application of linear algebra on machine learning.

Our tools have also matured since January 2025.  This version of our intelligent textbook was generated using Claude Code Skills.  We also put a much stronger focus on creating high-quality MicroSims.
