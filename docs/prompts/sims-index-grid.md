# MicroSim Index Grid Format

!!! prompt
    Modify the @docs/sims/index.md file to use the mkdocs-material grid         
    format.  Use this example:

     https://github.com/dmccreary/intro-to-physics-course/blob/main/docs/sims/index.md for the format 
     
     of the structure for each MicroSim.
     
     Generate a screen shot using the @~/.local/bin/bk-capture-screenshot program if there is no .png file within the microsim directory.  
     You must pass the path to the microsim to this shell script.
