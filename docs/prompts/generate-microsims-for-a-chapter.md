## Chapter 3 MicroSims

Set the context to @docs/chapters/03-systems-of-linear-equations/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each
diagram, use text within the <details markdown="1"> as input specification to the
microsim-generator skill to generate a microsim for each diagram.  When done, add a session
log to logs/ch-03-microsims.md

## Chapter 4 MicroSims

Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each
diagram, use text within the <details markdown="1"> as input specification to the
microsim-generator skill to generate a microsim for each diagram.  When done, add a session
log to logs/ch-04-microsims.md

## Chapter 5 MicroSims

Set the context to @docs/chapters/05-determinants-and-matrix-properties/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each

microsim-generator skill to generate a microsim for each diagram.  When done, add a session
log to logs/ch-05-microsims.md

## Chapter 6 MicroSims

Set the context to @docs/chapters/06-eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each

log to logs/ch-06-microsims.md

## Chapter 7 MicroSims

Set the context to @docs/chapters/07-matrix-decompositions/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each
diagram:

1. Use text within the <details markdown="1"> as input specification to the
microsim-generator skill to generate a microsim for each diagram.
2. Update the chapter content with an iframe element immediately after the #### Diagram: that links to the new MicroSim.
3. Update the mkdocs.yml file so the navigation has links to the new Microsims.

When done, add a session
log to logs/ch-07-microsims.md

## Chapter 8 MicroSims

Set the context to @docs/chapters/08-vector-spaces-and-inner-products/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each
diagram do the following:

1. Use text within the <details markdown="1"> as input specification to the
microsim-generator skill to generate a microsim for each diagram.
2. Update the chapter content with an embedded iframe element immediately after the #### Diagram: that links to the new MicroSim you just created.
3. Update the mkdocs.yml file so the navigation has links to the new Microsims.

When done, add a session log to logs/ch-08-microsims.md

## Chapter 9 MicroSims

Set the context to @docs/chapters/09-machine-learning-foundations/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each
