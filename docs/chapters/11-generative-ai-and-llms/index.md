# Generative AI and Large Language Models

## Summary

Modern generative AI systems rely heavily on sophisticated linear algebra. This chapter explores the mathematical foundations of transformers and large language models, including embedding spaces, attention mechanisms, query-key-value matrices, and multi-head attention. You will also learn about LoRA for efficient fine-tuning and latent space interpolation in generative models.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 19 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Embedding
2. Embedding Space
3. Word Embedding
4. Semantic Similarity
5. Cosine Similarity
6. Attention Mechanism
7. Self-Attention
8. Cross-Attention
9. Query Matrix
10. Key Matrix
11. Value Matrix
12. Attention Score
13. Attention Weights
14. Multi-Head Attention
15. Transformer Architecture
16. Position Encoding
17. LoRA
18. Latent Space
19. Interpolation
