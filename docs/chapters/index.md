## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook is designed for sequential learning - each chapter builds on concepts from previous chapters. The dependency structure ensures that prerequisite knowledge is always introduced before it's needed. While you can jump ahead to specific topics of interest, completing earlier chapters first will provide the strongest foundation.

Each chapter includes a list of concepts covered, allowing you to track your progress through the learning graph. Interactive microsimulations throughout the book help reinforce abstract mathematical concepts with visual, hands-on exploration.
