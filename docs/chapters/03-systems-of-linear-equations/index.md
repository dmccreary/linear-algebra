# Systems of Linear Equations

## Summary

This chapter teaches you to formulate and solve systems of linear equations, a fundamental skill with applications across all quantitative fields. You will master Gaussian elimination, understand row echelon forms, and learn to analyze when solutions exist, are unique, or are infinite. These computational techniques are essential for everything from optimization to neural network training.
