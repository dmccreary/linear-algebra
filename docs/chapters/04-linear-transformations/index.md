# Linear Transformations

## Summary

This chapter reveals how matrices represent transformations, connecting algebraic operations to geometric intuition. You will learn about rotation, scaling, shearing, reflection, and projection transformations, and understand abstract concepts like kernel, range, and change of basis. These ideas are fundamental to computer graphics, robotics, and understanding how neural networks transform data.
