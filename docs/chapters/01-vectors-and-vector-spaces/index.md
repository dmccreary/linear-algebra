# Vectors and Vector Spaces

## Summary

This chapter introduces vectors as the fundamental building blocks of linear algebra. Students explore vector operations, geometric interpretations, and the concept of vector spaces. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to perform vector operations, compute norms and distances, and work with the abstract concepts of span, linear independence, and basis vectors that form the foundation for all subsequent topics.
