# Optimization and Learning Algorithms

## Summary

Optimization is the engine of machine learning, and linear algebra provides the tools to understand and improve optimization algorithms. This chapter covers the Hessian matrix, convexity, Newton's method, and modern adaptive optimizers like Adam and RMSprop. You will also learn constrained optimization with Lagrange multipliers and KKT conditions.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Hessian Matrix
2. Convexity
3. Convex Function
4. Newtons Method
5. Quasi-Newton Method
6. BFGS Algorithm
7. SGD
8. Mini-Batch SGD
9. Momentum
10. Adam Optimizer
11. RMSprop
12. Lagrange Multiplier
13. Constrained Optimization
14. KKT Conditions

## Prerequisites
