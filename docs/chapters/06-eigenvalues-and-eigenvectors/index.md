# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

## Summary

One of the most important topics in linear algebra, eigenanalysis reveals the intrinsic structure of linear transformations. This chapter covers eigenvalues, eigenvectors, characteristic polynomials, and diagonalization. You will learn the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices and the power iteration method. These concepts are essential for PCA, stability analysis, and understanding how neural networks learn.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 17 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Eigenvalue
2. Eigenvector
3. Eigen Equation
4. Characteristic Polynomial
5. Characteristic Equation
6. Eigenspace
7. Algebraic Multiplicity
8. Geometric Multiplicity
9. Diagonalization
10. Diagonal Form
11. Similar Matrices
12. Complex Eigenvalue
13. Spectral Theorem
14. Symmetric Eigenvalues
15. Power Iteration
16. Dominant Eigenvalue
17. Eigendecomposition
