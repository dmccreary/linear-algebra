# Matrices and Matrix Operations

## Summary

Building on vectors, this chapter introduces matrices as collections of vectors and explores the rich algebra of matrix operations. You will learn about matrix notation, various special matrix types including diagonal, triangular, symmetric, and orthogonal matrices, and master core operations like multiplication, transpose, and inverse. These concepts form the computational backbone of all linear algebra applications.
