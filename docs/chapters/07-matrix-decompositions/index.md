# Matrix Decompositions

## Summary

Matrix factorizations provide powerful tools for analysis, computation, and dimensionality reduction. This chapter covers LU, QR, Cholesky, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Each decomposition has specific use cases: LU for solving systems efficiently, QR for least squares problems, Cholesky for symmetric positive definite matrices, and SVD for low-rank approximations and recommender systems.
