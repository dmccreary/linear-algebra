# Machine Learning Foundations

## Summary

This chapter explicitly connects linear algebra concepts to core machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will learn how data is represented as matrices, understand covariance and correlation, master Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and implement linear regression with regularization. Gradient descent, the workhorse of machine learning optimization, is covered in detail.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 20 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Feature Vector
2. Feature Matrix
3. Data Matrix
4. Covariance Matrix
5. Correlation Matrix
6. Standardization
7. PCA
8. Principal Component
9. Variance Explained
10. Scree Plot
11. Dimensionality Reduction
12. Linear Regression
13. Design Matrix
14. Ridge Regression
15. Lasso Regression
16. Regularization
17. Gradient Vector
18. Gradient Descent
19. Batch Gradient Descent
20. Learning Rate
