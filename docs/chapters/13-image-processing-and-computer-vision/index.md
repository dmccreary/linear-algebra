# Image Processing and Computer Vision

## Summary

Images are matrices of pixel values, making linear algebra the natural language for image processing and computer vision. This chapter covers image representation as matrices and tensors, convolution operations, image filtering (blur, sharpen, edge detection), Fourier transforms, and feature detection. You will also learn about homography for perspective transformations.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 16 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Image Matrix
2. Grayscale Image
3. RGB Image
4. Image Tensor
5. Image Convolution
6. Image Filter
7. Blur Filter
8. Sharpen Filter
9. Edge Detection
10. Sobel Operator
11. Fourier Transform
12. Frequency Domain
13. Image Compression
14. Color Space Transform
15. Feature Detection
16. Homography

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 2: Matrices and Matrix Operations](../02-matrices-and-matrix-operations/index.md)
- [Chapter 4: Linear Transformations](../04-linear-transformations/index.md)
- [Chapter 7: Matrix Decompositions](../07-matrix-decompositions/index.md) (for SVD-based compression)
- [Chapter 10: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](../10-neural-networks-and-deep-learning/index.md) (for tensors)
