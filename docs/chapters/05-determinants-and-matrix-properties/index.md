# Determinants and Matrix Properties

## Summary

Determinants reveal fundamental properties of matrices and transformations, with applications in solving systems and computing volumes. This chapter covers determinant computation methods, their properties, and geometric interpretation as the volume scaling factor of a transformation. You will also learn Cramer's rule and understand the relationship between determinants and matrix invertibility.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 13 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Determinant
2. 2x2 Determinant
3. 3x3 Determinant
4. Cofactor Expansion
5. Minor
6. Cofactor
7. Determinant Properties
8. Multiplicative Property
9. Transpose Determinant
10. Singular Matrix
11. Volume Scaling Factor
12. Signed Area
13. Cramers Rule
