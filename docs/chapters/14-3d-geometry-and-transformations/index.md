# 3D Geometry and Transformations

## Summary

Understanding 3D geometry is essential for robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles. This chapter covers 3D coordinate systems, rotation representations including Euler angles and quaternions, homogeneous coordinates, camera models with intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, stereo vision, and point cloud processing. These concepts form the foundation for any system that operates in 3D space.
