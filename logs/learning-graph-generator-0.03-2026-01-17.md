# Learning Graph Generator Session Log

**Skill Version:** 0.03
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Course:** Applied Linear Algebra for AI and Machine Learning

## Session Summary

Successfully generated a comprehensive learning graph with 300 concepts covering all 15 chapters of the course.

## Python Program Versions Used

- analyze-graph.py: (no version number in script)
- csv-to-json.py: v0.02
- taxonomy-distribution.py: (no version number in script)

## Steps Completed

### Step 1: Course Description Quality Assessment
- **Score:** 97/100
- Excellent coverage of Bloom's Taxonomy learning objectives
- All required elements present (title, prerequisites, audience, objectives)
- Generated course-description-assessment.md

### Step 2: Concept List Generation
- Generated 300 concepts covering all 15 chapters
- Concepts organized by course structure:
  - Part 1: Foundations (Chapters 1-4) - Concepts 1-100
  - Part 2: Advanced Matrix Theory (Chapters 5-8) - Concepts 101-168
  - Part 3: ML Applications (Chapters 9-12) - Concepts 169-247
  - Part 4: Computer Vision/Autonomous Systems (Chapters 13-15) - Concepts 248-300

### Step 3: Dependency Graph Creation
- Created learning-graph.csv with 300 concepts
- Fixed multiple circular dependencies during validation
- 509 edges (dependencies) created
- 2 foundational concepts: Scalar (ID: 1), Function (ID: 74)

### Step 4: Quality Validation
- Valid DAG structure confirmed
- All 300 concepts connected in single graph
- Maximum dependency chain: 19 concepts
- Top prerequisites: Matrix (25), Vector (18), Matrix Multiplication (13)
- 97 terminal/orphan concepts (expected for advanced topics)

### Step 5: Concept Taxonomy
- Created 15 taxonomy categories:
  - FOUND: Foundation Concepts (27)
  - MATOP: Matrix Operations (23)
  - LINSYS: Linear Systems (23)
  - TRANS: Transformations (27)
  - DETERM: Determinants (13)
  - EIGEN: Eigentheory (17)
  - DECOMP: Decompositions (19)
  - INPROD: Inner Products (19)
  - MLBASE: ML Foundations (20)
  - NEURAL: Neural Networks (26)
  - GENAI: Generative AI (19)
  - OPTIM: Optimization (14)
  - IMGPROC: Image Processing (16)
  - GEOM3D: 3D Geometry (17)
  - AUTON: Autonomous Systems (20)

### Step 6: Add Taxonomy to CSV
- Updated learning-graph.csv with TaxonomyID column

### Step 7: Generate Metadata
- Created metadata.json with Dublin Core-inspired fields

### Step 8: Generate Groups Section
- Created color-config.json for taxonomy colors
- Used pastel colors for readability

### Step 9: Generate learning-graph.json
- Used csv-to-json.py v0.02
- Output: 300 nodes, 509 edges, 15 groups
- Updated classifier names from abbreviations to full names

### Step 10: Taxonomy Distribution Report
- Generated taxonomy-distribution.md
- All categories under 30% threshold
- Good balance across categories

### Step 11: Create index.md
- Created learning graph introduction page
- Links to all generated documentation

### Step 12: Update mkdocs.yml
- Added Learning Graph section to navigation
- Includes all generated documentation files

## Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| course-description-assessment.md | Quality assessment of course description |
| concept-list.md | Numbered list of 300 concepts |
| learning-graph.csv | Dependency graph with taxonomy |
| metadata.json | Course metadata |
| color-config.json | Taxonomy colors |
| taxonomy-names.json | Taxonomy display names |
| learning-graph.json | Complete graph in vis-network format |
| concept-taxonomy.md | Taxonomy category definitions |
| quality-metrics.md | Graph quality validation report |
| taxonomy-distribution.md | Category distribution analysis |
| index.md | Learning graph introduction page |

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Review the concept list** - Verify all 300 concepts are appropriate
2. **Review the taxonomy** - Ensure categories align with course goals
3. **Review the learning graph** - Check dependency relationships make pedagogical sense
4. **Run book-chapter-generator skill** - Generate chapter content after review
5. **Build and test** - Run `mkdocs serve` to verify documentation
