# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `docs/` holds all site content for MkDocs, including chapter markdown in `docs/chapters/NN-chapter-name/`, MicroSims in `docs/sims/`, and shared assets in `docs/img/`, `docs/css/`, and `docs/js/`.
- `mkdocs.yml` defines navigation, theme, and plugins. Update this when adding pages.
- `plugins/` and `setup.py` define the custom `social_override` MkDocs plugin.
- `site/` is the built output (generated by `mkdocs build`).
- `src/` contains ad-hoc tooling (e.g., ESLint experiments) and is not part of the published site.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pip install -r requirments.txt` installs MkDocs dependencies for this repo.
- `mkdocs serve` runs a local dev server with live reload at `http://localhost:8000`.
- `mkdocs build` generates the static site into `site/`.
- `mkdocs gh-deploy` builds and publishes the site to GitHub Pages.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Markdown is the primary source format; keep headings descriptive and keep paragraphs short.
- Chapter folders follow `NN-chapter-name` naming, with main content in `index.md` and optional `quiz.md`.
- MicroSims use kebab-case directories under `docs/sims/` and keep HTML, CSS, and JS in separate files (no inline script/style).
- Follow the MicroSim layout conventions described in `CLAUDE.md` (iframe embed, fullscreen/edit links, and no indentation inside `<details markdown="1">`).

## Testing Guidelines
- There is no automated test suite. Validate changes by running `mkdocs serve` and clicking through updated pages.
- For MicroSims, open `docs/sims/<sim-name>/main.html` in a browser and verify controls, layout, and iframe embedding.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use short, imperative summaries (e.g., “Add visualizers for LoRA”). Keep messages concise and descriptive.
- PRs should include a brief description, link any related issue, and add screenshots or GIFs for visual/content updates (especially MicroSims).

## Configuration & Content Tips
- Use `docs/course-description.md` and `docs/learning-graph/` as references for tone and prerequisite structure.
- Keep MathJax equations in standard `$...$` or `$$...$$` format.
